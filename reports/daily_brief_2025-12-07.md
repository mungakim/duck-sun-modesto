# Daily Solar Briefing for Modesto, CA
*Generated: December 7, 2025 at 4:12 PM*

## TL;DR - Today's Grid Impact (Dec 7)
**🔴 MINIMAL DUCK CURVE TODAY** - 100% cloud cover severely suppresses solar production. Peak solar factor only reaches 5.8% during duck hours (HE12-13). No significant ramping events expected. Conventional generation will carry most load.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-16)
| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover | Impact Level |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| HE09 | 0.01 (1%) | 100% | Minimal |
| HE10 | 0.02 (2%) | 100% | Minimal |
| HE11 | 0.048 (5%) | 100% | Low |
| HE12 | 0.058 (6%) | 100% | Low |
| HE13 | 0.058 (6%) | 100% | Low |
| HE14 | 0.047 (5%) | 100% | Low |
| HE15 | 0.034 (3%) | 100% | Minimal |
| HE16 | 0.02 (2%) | 100% | Minimal |

## 3-Day Lookahead Summary

**December 8 (Tomorrow)**: Gradual improvement expected with partial clearing in afternoon hours. Solar factors jump to 11.6% by HE15 as cloud cover drops to 57%. Still well below normal winter production.

**December 9 (Day 2)**: Mixed conditions with intermittent breaks in cloud cover. Notable spike to 30.2% solar factor during HE12 with partial clearing (60% clouds), followed by return to overcast conditions. Monitor for potential ramping variability.

**December 10 (Day 3)**: **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT** - Clear conditions develop with solar factors reaching 48.4% by HE13. This represents a return to more typical winter solar production levels. Duck curve characteristics will be prominent again.

## Weather-Related Advisories

⚠️ **Extended Overcast Period**: Current weather pattern showing persistent 100% cloud cover through most of forecast period.

⚠️ **Tuesday Transition Alert**: December 10 shows rapid transition from cloudy to clear conditions. Expect sharp increase in solar production variability and return of pronounced duck curve effects.

✅ **Grid Stability**: Current minimal solar contribution reduces renewable intermittency concerns but increases reliance on conventional generation resources.
