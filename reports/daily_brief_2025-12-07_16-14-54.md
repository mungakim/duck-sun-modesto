## 3-Day Lookahead Analysis

### December 8 - Marginal Improvement Expected
- **Morning-Midday**: Slightly better solar factors (up to 8% around noon)
- **Afternoon Clearing**: Cloud cover drops significantly (51-57%) during HE14-16
- **Notable**: Expect modest duck curve effect with peak factor of 11.6% at HE15

### December 9 - Mixed Cloud Conditions
- **Variable Performance**: Solar factors fluctuate dramatically due to shifting clouds
- **Best Window**: HE11-12 showing strong factors (28-30%) with partial clearing
- **Concern**: Rapid transitions between cloudy/clear may cause grid instability

### December 10 - Significant Solar Return ⚠️
- **Clear Morning**: Excellent conditions developing with minimal cloud cover
- **Peak Performance**: Solar factors reaching 48% during HE13
- **Duck Curve Alert**: Full duck curve profile returns - prepare for steep ramps

## Weather Advisories

⛅ **Persistent Overcast Today**: 100% cloud cover throughout duck hours eliminates typical solar variability concerns

🌤️ **Clearing Pattern Developing**: Dec 8-10 shows progressive cloud clearing, with Dec 10 featuring near-optimal conditions

🔄 **Ramp Rate Warning**: Transition from today's minimal solar to Dec 10's strong output represents significant grid planning consideration
