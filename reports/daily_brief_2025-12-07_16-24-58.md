# Daily Solar Briefing - Modesto, CA
*Generated: December 7, 2025, 4:25 PM*

## TL;DR Today (Dec 7)
⚠️ **MINIMAL DUCK CURVE IMPACT** - Heavy overcast conditions limit solar production to only 6% of capacity during peak hours. Conventional generation will carry full load through normal duck curve period.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-HE16)

| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| HE09 | 0.010 (1%)  | 100%        |
| HE10 | 0.020 (2%)  | 100%        |
| HE11 | 0.048 (5%)  | 100%        |
| HE12 | 0.058 (6%)  | 100%        |
| HE13 | 0.058 (6%)  | 100%        |
| HE14 | 0.047 (5%)  | 100%        |
| HE15 | 0.034 (3%)  | 100%        |
| HE16 | 0.020 (2%)  | 100%        |

**Peak Production**: 6% capacity at HE12-13  
**Average Duck Hours**: 3.4% capacity

## 3-Day Lookahead

**December 8 (Tomorrow)**
- Similar cloudy start with slight improvement in afternoon
- Solar production reaches 12% capacity briefly during HE15
- Some cloud clearing expected late afternoon (51-57% cloud cover HE15-16)
- Still well below normal duck curve impacts

**December 9 (Monday)**
- **Mixed conditions** with potential for higher variability
- Morning breakthrough possible with 30% capacity around HE11-12
- Heavy clouds return afternoon, dropping to 14% capacity by HE13
- Monitor for rapid solar swings during mid-morning transition

**December 10 (Tuesday)**
- **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT EXPECTED**
- Clear morning conditions allowing 48% capacity by HE13-14
- Strong duck curve pattern likely to return
- Prepare for normal solar ramping challenges

## Weather Advisories

🌫️ **Persistent Overcast Pattern**: Complete cloud cover through Sunday limits solar contribution to grid mix.

⚡ **Tuesday Solar Return**: Prepare for return to normal duck curve operations with solar factors approaching 50% capacity during peak hours.

📊 **Grid Impact**: Current conditions require minimal solar-related grid balancing. Conventional units should maintain normal dispatch patterns through weekend.
