# Daily Solar Briefing - Modesto, CA
*Generated at: December 7, 2025 4:58 PM*

## TL;DR
**Today (Dec 7): Severely compromised solar production** due to 100% cloud cover throughout duck curve hours. Peak solar factor only reaching 0.058 (~6% of potential). Grid operators should prepare for minimal solar contribution and higher thermal dispatch needs.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-16)

| Hour Ending | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover (%) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| HE09        | 0.010       | 100%          |
| HE10        | 0.020       | 100%          |
| HE11        | 0.048       | 100%          |
| HE12        | 0.058       | 100%          |
| HE13        | 0.058       | 100%          |
| HE14        | 0.047       | 100%          |
| HE15        | 0.027       | 100%          |
| HE16        | 0.017       | 100%          |

**Peak Solar Factor**: 0.058 at HE12-13 (only 6% of optimal production)

## 3-Day Lookahead Summary

### Sunday, December 8
- **Moderate improvement**: Solar factors increase slightly, peaking at 0.116 during HE15
- **Mixed cloud conditions**: 100% coverage morning hours, clearing to 50-60% afternoon
- **Expected impact**: Still below-normal solar production, but better than today

### Monday, December 9
- **Variable conditions**: Strong morning performance (0.30+ solar factors HE11-12) followed by heavy clouds
- **Key concern**: Rapid transitions between clear and overcast conditions may create grid stability challenges
- **Peak production**: Brief window of 30% solar factor around midday

### Tuesday, December 10
- **Excellent conditions**: Clear skies developing with solar factors reaching 0.48+ during peak hours
- **Strong duck curve impact**: Expect significant solar ramp and subsequent evening net load climb
- **Grid preparation**: Full solar contribution expected - prepare for typical duck curve challenges

## Weather Advisories

⚠️ **IMMEDIATE CONCERN**: Today's persistent 100% cloud cover eliminates the typical duck curve solar ramp, requiring increased thermal generation throughout afternoon hours.

⚠️ **Monday Volatility**: Rapid cloud transitions may cause sudden solar production changes. Monitor for potential regulation and ramping challenges.

✅ **Tuesday Recovery**: First clear day in forecast - expect return to normal duck curve patterns with strong afternoon solar production and evening ramp-down needs.
