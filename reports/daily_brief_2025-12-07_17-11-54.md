# Daily Solar Briefing - Modesto, CA
**Date**: December 7, 2025  
**Generated**: 17:12 PST

## TL;DR
⚠️ **CRITICAL: Severe solar deficit today - virtually no duck curve ramp.** 100% overcast conditions suppress solar factors to just 6% peak capacity. Grid will need heavy conventional generation throughout daylight hours.

## Today's Solar Performance (HE09-16)

| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover | Key Impact |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| HE09 | 0.010 (1%) | 100% | Minimal production |
| HE10 | 0.020 (2%) | 100% | Well below normal |
| HE11 | 0.048 (5%) | 100% | Peak morning deficit |
| HE12 | 0.058 (6%) | 100% | **Daily peak - still critical** |
| HE13 | 0.058 (6%) | 100% | Sustained low output |
| HE14 | 0.047 (5%) | 100% | Declining rapidly |
| HE15 | 0.027 (3%) | 100% | Afternoon drop-off |
| HE16 | 0.017 (2%) | 100% | Return to baseline |

**Today's Duck Impact**: Essentially eliminated - no significant solar ramp to manage.

## 3-Day Lookahead

### Sunday (Dec 8) - Gradual Improvement Expected
- **Morning**: Remains overcast with minimal production through HE13
- **Afternoon Breakthrough**: Cloud cover drops to 50-60% during HE14-16, enabling solar factor to reach 12% peak
- **Grid Impact**: Slight duck curve emergence in late afternoon only

### Monday (Dec 9) - Mixed Conditions, Variable Output
- **Peak Production**: Solar factors reach 30% capacity during HE11-12 with partial cloud breaks
- **Volatility Risk**: High cloud variability (58-100%) creates potential for rapid production swings
- **Operational Note**: Prepare for intermittent ramping challenges

### Tuesday (Dec 10) - Return to Normal Operations
- **Clear Morning**: Excellent conditions with solar factors reaching 48% capacity
- **Full Duck Curve**: Strong ramp from HE09-13, normal afternoon decline
- **Grid Impact**: Resume standard duck curve management protocols

## Weather Advisories

🌧️ **Overcast Pattern**: Dense cloud deck persists through Sunday morning - maintain elevated conventional dispatch

☀️ **Clearing Trend**: Significant improvement expected Monday-Tuesday with return to seasonal solar production patterns

**Operational Recommendation**: Minimize solar forecasting reliance today; increase dispatchable resource availability through Sunday noon.
