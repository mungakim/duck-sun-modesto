# Daily Solar Briefing for Modesto, CA
**Generated:** December 7, 2025 at 5:18 PM

## TL;DR - TODAY'S GRID IMPACT
⚠️ **OVERCAST CONDITIONS** - Minimal solar generation expected today with solar factors peaking at only 6% during duck curve hours. Traditional generation resources will need to carry full load throughout the day. No significant duck curve dynamics expected.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-HE16)

| Hour Ending | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover (%) |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 09:00       | 0.010        | 100%           |
| 10:00       | 0.020        | 100%           |
| 11:00       | 0.048        | 100%           |
| 12:00       | 0.058        | 100%           |
| 13:00       | 0.058        | 100%           |
| 14:00       | 0.047        | 100%           |
| 15:00       | 0.027        | 100%           |
| 16:00       | 0.014        | 100%           |

**Peak Solar Factor:** 0.058 (5.8%) at HE12-13
**Average During Duck Hours:** 0.035 (3.5%)

## 3-Day Lookahead (Dec 8-10)

**Sunday, Dec 8:** Similar overcast conditions with slight improvement. Solar factors remain very low (peak ~8%) through most of the day, with minor clearing in the afternoon (up to 12% around HE15). Cloud cover begins breaking up late in the duck curve period.

**Monday, Dec 9:** Partially mixed conditions. Morning remains overcast, but significant clearing expected mid-day with solar factors jumping to 28-30% during HE11-12 before clouds return. More variable solar output expected.

**Tuesday, Dec 10:** **CLEAR CONDITIONS EXPECTED** - Major improvement with solar factors reaching 48% during peak hours (HE13). This will mark the return of normal duck curve dynamics with significant solar ramp-up starting HE09 and ramping down after HE14.

## Weather Advisories

🌫️ **Heavy Overcast Pattern:** Complete cloud cover (100%) dominates the first two days, severely limiting solar production to <10% of capacity.

🌤️ **Transition Day Monday:** Expect variable solar output on Dec 9 with potential for rapid changes between overcast and partial clearing - monitor real-time conditions closely.

☀️ **Clear Skies Return Tuesday:** First significant solar production day of the forecast period - prepare for normal duck curve operations with potential for over-generation concerns during midday hours.

**Grid Operator Recommendation:** Maintain conventional generation at full capacity through Sunday-Monday. Begin preparing for duck curve management protocols starting Tuesday morning.
