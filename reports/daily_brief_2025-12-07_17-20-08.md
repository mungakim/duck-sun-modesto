# Daily Solar Briefing - Modesto, CA
**Generated:** December 7, 2025 | 5:20 PM PST

## TL;DR - Today's Grid Impact
**MINIMAL DUCK CURVE EFFECT** - Today's overcast conditions are severely limiting solar production. Peak solar factor of only 0.058 during midday hours means minimal solar ramp stress on the grid. No significant grid management challenges expected today.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-HE16)

| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover (%) | Status |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| HE09 | 0.010 | 100% | Minimal |
| HE10 | 0.020 | 100% | Minimal |
| HE11 | 0.048 | 100% | Low |
| HE12 | 0.058 | 100% | Low |
| HE13 | 0.058 | 100% | Low |
| HE14 | 0.047 | 100% | Low |
| HE15 | 0.027 | 100% | Minimal |
| HE16 | 0.014 | 100% | Minimal |

**Peak Production:** HE12-HE13 at 5.8% of optimal capacity

## 3-Day Lookahead Summary

**Tomorrow (Dec 8):** Slight improvement expected with cloud cover dropping to 51-83% in afternoon hours. Solar factors may reach 0.116 around HE15, but still well below normal production levels.

**Monday (Dec 9):** Mixed conditions with a notable mid-morning clearing (HE11-HE12) showing solar factors up to 0.302. However, afternoon hours return to 100% cloud cover. Expect moderate duck curve activity.

**Tuesday (Dec 10):** **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT** - Clear skies expected with solar factors reaching 0.484 at HE13. This represents near-optimal conditions and will create a pronounced duck curve effect requiring active grid management.

## Weather Advisory
- **Extended Overcast Period:** 100% cloud cover persists through most of the weekend
- **Tuesday Clearing Event:** Prepare for sharp solar ramp-up on Dec 10 with peak factors approaching 50% of optimal
- **Variable Conditions Monday:** Intermittent clearing may cause rapid solar fluctuations requiring flexible dispatch resources
