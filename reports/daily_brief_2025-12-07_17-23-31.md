**Generated at: 2025-12-07T17:23:38**

## TL;DR - Today's Grid Impact
⚠️ **MINIMAL SOLAR TODAY** - Expect 95%+ reduction in typical winter solar generation due to 100% cloud cover. Peak solar factor reaches only 0.058 (vs typical 0.8+). Conventional generation will need to carry the full load during typical duck curve hours.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-16)

| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover | Status |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 09:00 | 0.010 | 100% | Negligible |
| 10:00 | 0.020 | 100% | Negligible |
| 11:00 | 0.048 | 100% | Very Low |
| 12:00 | 0.058 | 100% | Very Low |
| 13:00 | 0.058 | 100% | Very Low |
| 14:00 | 0.047 | 100% | Very Low |

## 3-Day Lookahead

### Sunday (12/8)
- **Similar overcast conditions** with 100% cloud cover through most duck curve hours
- Slight improvement late afternoon (HE15-16) as clouds reduce to 50-60%
- Peak solar factor: 0.116 at HE15 - still well below normal winter levels

### Monday (12/9) 
- **Mixed conditions** - starts overcast but shows significant clearing mid-day
- Notable improvement at HE11-12 with solar factors reaching 0.278-0.302
- Cloud breaks provide temporary relief but return to 100% coverage by afternoon

### Tuesday (12/10)
- **Best day of the period** - clearest conditions with excellent morning clearing
- Low cloud cover (5-12%) during peak hours HE13-16
- Solar factors reach healthy levels: 0.484 peak at HE13
- Strong solar contribution expected, normal duck curve behavior returns

## Weather Advisory
🌫️ **Dense overcast pattern dominates** the next 48 hours with minimal solar penetration. Grid operators should prepare for:
- Extended conventional generation requirements
- Absence of typical midday solar ramp
- Return to normal duck curve dynamics by Tuesday

**Next significant solar weather event:** Tuesday's clearing pattern offers first substantial solar contribution of the forecast period.
