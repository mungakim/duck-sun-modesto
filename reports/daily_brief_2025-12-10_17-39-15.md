# Daily Solar Briefing - Modesto, CA
**Generated:** December 10, 2025 at 5:39 PM

## TL;DR - Today's Grid Impact
🌥️ **OVERCAST CONDITIONS TODAY** - Solar production severely limited due to 100% cloud cover. Duck curve hours (HE09-16) showing minimal solar factors (0.01-0.07). Expect higher conventional generation needs throughout the day.

## Today's Duck Curve Hours (HE09-16)

| Hour | Solar Factor | Cloud Cover (%) | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| HE09 | 0.014 | 100% | Minimal production |
| HE10 | 0.032 | 100% | Still very low |
| HE11 | 0.040 | 100% | Peak but suppressed |
| HE12 | 0.065 | 100% | Midday maximum |
| HE13 | 0.069 | 100% | Daily peak (very low) |
| HE14 | 0.049 | 100% | Declining |
| HE15 | 0.031 | 100% | Continued decline |
| HE16 | 0.020 | 100% | Minimal evening solar |

**Today's Assessment:** Complete cloud suppression with peak solar factor reaching only 0.069 at HE13 - approximately 93% below normal December conditions.

## 3-Day Lookahead Summary

**Tomorrow (Dec 11):** 
- Cloudy morning transitioning to partial clearing
- Solar factors improve slightly (peak 0.113 at HE14)
- Cloud cover decreases from 100% to 47% during duck hours
- Still below-normal production expected

**Thursday (Dec 12):** 
- **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT** - Clear skies developing
- Strong solar ramp with factors reaching 0.55 at midday
- Classic duck curve pattern returns (0.087 to 0.55 range)
- Near-optimal conditions for December

**Friday (Dec 13):**
- **EXCELLENT CONDITIONS** continue
- Clear skies (0% cloud cover)
- Full duck curve impact with peak solar factor 0.55
- Strong ramping characteristics return to normal

## Weather-Related Advisories

⚠️ **GRID OPERATOR ALERTS:**
1. **Today:** Prepare for minimal solar contribution - maintain higher spinning reserves
2. **Tomorrow:** Gradual improvement but still suppressed output
3. **Thu-Fri:** Sharp transition to high solar - prepare for significant ramping events and potential overgeneration during midday hours

**Duck Curve Impact:** The classic duck curve pattern is completely flattened today and tomorrow, returning to normal characteristics Thursday onward. Plan for dramatically different net load profiles across this 4-day period.
