## 🚨 TULE FOG WARNING
**CRITICAL CONDITIONS DETECTED FOR TOMORROW**

- **Duration:** HE09-HE13 (5 hours of critical impact)
- **Peak Impact:** HE10-HE11 (fog probability 66-56%)
- **Solar Reduction:** 85% during fog hours
- **Recovery:** Expected by HE14 as temperatures rise above dewpoint

**Fog Drivers:**
- Dewpoint depression < 2.5°C (saturation conditions)
- Wind speeds < 8 km/h (stagnation in Modesto Bowl)
- Cold air pooling in Central Valley topography

**Grid Impact:** Expect severely reduced solar generation during morning ramp period. Backup generation should be staged for HE09-HE13.

---

## Operational Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Stage backup generation for Dec 13 morning duck curve
2. **Short-term:** Conditions improve significantly Dec 14-16 with higher temperatures
3. **Watch:** Dec 19 shows return to overcast conditions

## Agent Memory Summary
**Key Finding:** Major Tule fog event identified for December 13 morning hours with 85% solar production reduction during critical duck curve period HE09-HE13.

**Key Observations:**
- Current METAR validates fog risk models with 2°C dewpoint depression and calm winds
- Consensus temperature model shows strong agreement between US, European, and Canadian sources
- Recovery pattern begins HE14 with clearing fog and normal solar production resuming

**Decisions/Recommendations:**
- Issue CRITICAL fog warning for Dec 13 HE09-HE13 with backup generation staging recommendation
- Highlight improving conditions Dec 14-16 for medium-term planning relief
