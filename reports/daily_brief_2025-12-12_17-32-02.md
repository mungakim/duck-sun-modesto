## 🌫️ TULE FOG WARNING - CRITICAL CONDITIONS

**Active Period:** HE09-HE13 (9 AM - 1 PM) December 13  
**Fog Probability:** Up to 69% during peak hours  
**Impact:** 85% reduction in solar production during morning duck curve hours  

**Meteorological Conditions Supporting Fog:**
- Dewpoint depression < 2.5°C through morning hours
- Wind speeds < 8 km/h (stagnant air mass)
- 100% cloud cover maintaining radiative cooling
- Classic Central Valley inversion pattern in the "Modesto Bowl"

**Grid Impact:** Expect significantly reduced solar generation during typical morning ramp period. Conventional generation will need to compensate for lost renewable capacity.

---

## Weekend Recovery Outlook
Saturday (Dec 14) shows marked improvement with consensus temperature rising to 7.4°C and fog-adjusted solar values returning to normal levels (112 W/m²). Clear pattern continues through Tuesday before next weather system approaches.

## Agent Memory Summary
**Key Finding:** Critical Tule fog event active through Friday morning with 85% solar production losses during duck curve hours HE09-HE13, followed by weekend clearing pattern.

**Key Observations:**
- Current METAR confirms fog-supportive conditions with 2°C dewpoint depression and calm winds
- Five consecutive hours of CRITICAL fog risk during tomorrow's solar ramp period
- Weekend recovery pattern shows strong temperature rise and clearing skies beginning Saturday

**Decisions/Recommendations:**
- Alert dispatchers to prepare conventional generation backup for Friday morning duck curve period
- Monitor fog dissipation timing as afternoon solar recovery may be earlier than forecasted if clearing accelerates
