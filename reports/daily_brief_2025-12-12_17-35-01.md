# Modesto Grid Solar Briefing | 2025-12-13 00:35 PST
**Duck Sun Modesto: Uncanny Edition | Consensus Temperature Model**

## TL;DR - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
🚨 **CRITICAL FOG EVENT PERSISTS** - Tule fog conditions WORSENING from previous run. Five consecutive CRITICAL fog hours during tomorrow's duck curve (HE09-HE13) with 85% solar production losses. Backup conventional generation required. Slight improvement expected by HE14.

## Conditions vs Previous Run
Previous run identified critical fog through Friday morning. **Current conditions are WORSENING** - ground truth METAR now shows 2°C dewpoint depression (down from previous) with zero wind and overcast at 600ft, confirming active fog development. Fog probability peaked at 69% during mid-morning hours.

## Tomorrow's HE09-16 Duck Curve Analysis
| Hour | Solar Adjusted (W/m²) | Risk Level | Fog Probability |
|------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| HE09 | **7.9** | CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 55% |
| HE10 | **20.5** | CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 65% |
| HE11 | **27.9** | CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | **69%** |
| HE12 | **33.9** | CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 39% |
| HE13 | **34.7** | CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 13% |
| HE14 | **181.0** | LOW | 5% |
| HE15 | **191.0** | LOW | 5% |
| HE16 | **134.0** | LOW | 9% |

## ⚠️ TULE FOG WARNING - ACTIVE EVENT
**CRITICAL**: Five consecutive hours of active fog during solar ramp period. Peak fog probability 69% at HE11. Solar production reduced to 15% of normal during HE09-HE13. 

**Fog dissipation expected by HE14** with rapid solar recovery to normal levels. Weekend outlook shows clearing pattern with temperatures rising to 7.4°C Saturday.

## Operational Recommendations
1. **Maintain conventional backup generation** through HE13
2. **Monitor fog lift timing** - rapid solar recovery possible after HE14
3. **Prepare for weekend normalization** starting Saturday
4. **Continue fog monitoring** - conditions remain conducive through early morning hours

## Agent Memory Summary
**Key Finding:** Tule fog event has intensified since previous run, with ground truth METAR confirming worsening conditions and peak fog probability reaching 69% during tomorrow's mid-morning solar ramp.

**Key Observations:**
- Ground conditions deteriorated with dewpoint depression dropping to 2.0°C and winds going completely calm
- Five consecutive CRITICAL fog hours during duck curve represent most severe impact period
- Clear afternoon recovery pattern expected with solar returning to 181 W/m² by HE14

**Decisions Made:**
- Recommend maintaining conventional backup through HE13 due to 85% solar production losses
- Alert operators to potential rapid solar recovery starting HE14 as fog lifts
- Weekend clearing pattern confirms return to normal operations by Saturday
