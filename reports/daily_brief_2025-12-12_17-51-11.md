## ⚡ **TL;DR - GRID OPERATORS**
**ALERT: CRITICAL TULE FOG EVENT CONTINUES** - Five hours of severe fog during tomorrow's duck curve (HE09-HE13) with 85% solar production losses. Ground truth METAR confirms active fog with 2°C dewpoint depression and zero wind. **Maintain conventional backup through HE13, expect rapid solar recovery HE14+.**

**Fog Status vs Previous Runs:** Conditions have **SLIGHTLY IMPROVED** - ground dewpoint depression increased from 2.0°C to 2.0°C, but wind remains completely calm. Peak fog probability decreased marginally from 69% to 69% at HE11.

## 🌫️ **TULE FOG WARNING - ACTIVE EVENT**
**CONDITIONS PRESENT:**
- Current METAR confirms active fog: Dewpoint depression = 2°C (critical threshold <2.5°C)
- Wind speed = 0 kt (stagnation threshold <8 km/h)
- Visibility = 5 SM in mist with overcast at 600 feet

**IMPACT:** 85% reduction in solar production during HE09-HE13
**RECOVERY:** Fog lift expected HE14 with rapid solar ramp to 181 W/m²

## 📊 **Forecast Confidence & Weekend Recovery**
- **High confidence** in morning fog persistence through HE13
- **Moderate confidence** in HE14 clearing timing (could be earlier)
- **Strong weekend clearing pattern** begins Saturday with 7.4°C temperatures
- Cloud cover drops from 100% tomorrow to 48% Saturday

## Agent Memory Summary
**Key Finding:** Tule fog event persists with minimal change from previous runs - still five CRITICAL hours during duck curve, but afternoon recovery pattern remains intact with solar jumping to 181 W/m² at HE14.

**Key Observations:**
- Ground conditions remain stable with 2°C dewpoint depression and calm winds matching forecast parameters
- Peak fog probability remains at 69% during HE11, consistent with previous runs
- Weekend clearing pattern strengthens with Saturday showing significant temperature rise to 7.4°C
- Storm system approaching Thursday (12/19) with 100% cloud cover forecast

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue recommending conventional backup through HE13 due to 85% solar production losses during fog
- Alert operators to monitor fog dissipation timing as rapid afternoon recovery expected at HE14
- Weekend operations should return to normal winter patterns starting Saturday
