## ⚠️ TULE FOG ALERT: PEAK INTENSITY REACHED

**ESCALATION:** This represents the **MOST SEVERE** fog conditions across five consecutive briefings:
- **Peak fog probability jumps to 84%** at HE11 (up from 69% in previous runs)
- **Five consecutive CRITICAL hours** during solar ramp (HE09-HE13)
- **85% solar production losses** throughout morning duck curve
- **Rapid afternoon recovery** begins HE14 as fog dissipates

**Meteorological Setup:**
- Dewpoint depression: 2°C (saturation threshold)  
- Wind speeds: Near-calm to 4.5 km/h (ideal for fog persistence)
- Temperature inversion: Classic Modesto Bowl pattern
- Ground truth confirms deteriorating visibility conditions

---

## Grid Operations Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Maintain conventional generation backup through HE13
2. **CRITICAL TRANSITION:** Monitor HE13-HE14 for rapid solar recovery (158 W/m² jump)
3. **Weekend Operations:** Normal patterns resume Saturday (Dec 15) with temperatures rising to 9.3°C
4. **Storm Watch:** Major weather system approaching Thursday (Dec 19) with 100% cloud cover

## Agent Memory Summary

**Key Finding:** Tule fog event reaches PEAK INTENSITY with fog probability surging to 84% at HE11 - the highest recorded across five consecutive briefings, indicating the most severe solar production impacts yet forecasted.

**Key Observations:**
- Peak fog probability increases dramatically from 69% to 84% during HE11, representing significant deterioration
- Ground truth METAR continues to validate forecast parameters with 2°C dewpoint depression and calm conditions
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain consistent timing but with intensified probability peaks
- Weekend clearing pattern remains robust with Sunday (Dec 15) showing strong temperature rise to 9.3°C

**Decisions Made:**
- Escalate alert status due to peak fog intensity reaching 84% - highest of any briefing in series
- Continue recommending full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar losses
- Alert operators to monitor rapid afternoon solar recovery beginning HE14 with potential for earlier clearing
