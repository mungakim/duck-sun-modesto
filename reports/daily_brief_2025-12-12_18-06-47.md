# Duck Sun Modesto: Solar Briefing for December 13, 2025
*Generated: 2025-12-12 18:07:01 PST*

## TL;DR - GRID OPERATIONS ALERT 🚨
**CRITICAL TULE FOG EVENT CONTINUES INTO FRIDAY** - Five CRITICAL hours during duck curve (HE09-HE13) with 85% solar production losses. Peak fog probability has reached **70% at HE11** - slightly higher than previous runs. Weekend clearing pattern remains intact with strong temperature rise Sunday. **MAINTAIN CONVENTIONAL BACKUP THROUGH HE13.**

**Fog Status vs Previous Runs:** Conditions show **SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION** - peak fog probability increased from 69% to 70%, but overall pattern remains consistent with five CRITICAL hours.

## 🚨 TULE FOG WARNING - ACTIVE EVENT

**FIVE CRITICAL HOURS** during duck curve (HE09-HE13) with 85% solar production losses due to active Tule fog conditions.

**Key Changes from Previous Runs:**
- Peak fog probability increased to **70% at HE11** (up from 69%)
- Ground truth METAR confirms persistent fog-supportive conditions
- Five consecutive CRITICAL hours maintain consistent timing pattern
- Clear afternoon recovery pattern intact starting HE14

**Physical Conditions Supporting Fog:**
- Dewpoint depression: 0.1-1.2°C during CRITICAL hours
- Wind speeds: <6 km/h (stagnation conditions)
- 100% cloud cover maintaining radiative cooling

**Grid Impact:**
- Expected solar losses: 85% during HE09-HE13
- Rapid recovery expected: HE14 solar jumps to 186 W/m²
- Weekend operations return to normal by Saturday

---

## Operational Recommendations
1. **MAINTAIN** conventional backup generation through HE13
2. **MONITOR** fog dissipation timing - afternoon solar recovery may occur earlier if clearing accelerates
3. **PREPARE** for rapid solar ramp starting HE14 (186 W/m² expected)
4. Weekend clearing pattern confirms normal operations resume Saturday

---

## Agent Memory Summary

**Key Finding:** Tule fog event shows SLIGHT INTENSIFICATION with peak fog probability increasing to 70% at HE11 (up from 69% in previous runs), representing the highest recorded across six consecutive briefings and indicating continued deterioration of solar production conditions.

**Key Observations:**
- Peak fog probability reached 70% during HE11 - new maximum across all briefings in series
- Ground truth METAR continues validating forecast with 1°C dewpoint depression and light winds
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain exact timing pattern but with intensified peak probability
- Weekend clearing pattern remains robust with Sunday temperature rise to 9.3°C confirming fog breakup

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue recommending full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar production losses
- Alert operators to monitor HE13-HE14 transition for rapid solar recovery as afternoon clearing begins
- Confirm weekend operations return to normal patterns starting Saturday with temperature rise
