# Duck Sun Modesto: Uncanny Edition - Solar Briefing
**Generated:** 2025-12-12 18:16 PST | **Sources:** Open-Meteo, NWS, Met.no

## TL;DR - URGENT
🚨 **TULE FOG ALERT CONTINUES** - Five consecutive CRITICAL fog hours remain during duck curve (HE09-HE13). Ground truth shows deteriorating conditions with dewpoint depression now at just 1°C (down from 2°C). Solar production will be SEVERELY IMPACTED with 85% losses through HE13, then rapid recovery at HE14.

**Previous Run Comparison:** Fog conditions have WORSENED since last briefing. Peak fog probability decreased slightly from 70% to 70% at HE11, but ground truth shows significant deterioration with dewpoint depression dropping from 2°C to 1°C.

## Current Ground Truth - KMOD METAR
**Station:** KMOD (Modesto City-County Airport)  
**Time:** 2025-12-13 01:53 UTC  
**Conditions:** 5°C / 4°C dewpoint | Wind: 360° at 3kt | Visibility: 5SM in MIST | Sky: Overcast 500ft  
**Analysis:** 1°C dewpoint depression confirms active fog formation with light winds - validates forecast parameters.

## 🚨 TULE FOG WARNING
**Active Period:** HE09-HE13 (5 consecutive hours)  
**Peak Impact:** HE11 with 70% fog probability  
**Solar Impact:** 85% production loss during fog hours  
**Recovery:** Rapid clearing expected at HE14 with solar jumping to 186 W/m²

**Conditions Supporting Fog:**
- Dewpoint depression: 1°C (CRITICAL - down from 2°C last run)
- Wind speed: <6 km/h (stagnation confirmed)
- Overcast conditions trapping cold air in Modesto Bowl

## Grid Operation Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action:** Maintain full conventional backup through HE13
2. **Transition Alert:** Monitor HE13-HE14 for rapid solar recovery
3. **Weekend Outlook:** Normal operations resume Saturday (Dec 14) with temperature rising to 6.6°C
4. **Storm Watch:** Major system approaching Thursday (Dec 19) with 100% cloud cover

## Agent Memory Summary
**Key Finding:** Tule fog event shows WORSENING ground conditions with dewpoint depression dropping to just 1°C (down from 2°C in previous run), while peak fog probability at HE11 remains stable at 70%, indicating continued severe solar production impacts.

**Key Observations:**
- Ground truth METAR confirms deteriorating conditions with dewpoint depression now at critical 1°C threshold
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain exact timing pattern with peak at HE11 (70% probability)
- Afternoon clearing pattern remains robust with solar recovery to 186 W/m² at HE14
- Weekend clearing strengthens with Saturday temperature rise to 6.6°C confirming fog breakup

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue recommending full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar production losses
- Alert operators to monitor rapid transition at HE14 as fog dissipates and solar production recovers
- Confirm weekend operations return to normal patterns beginning Saturday with improved temperatures
