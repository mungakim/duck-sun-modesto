# Duck Sun Modesto: Uncanny Edition
## Daily Solar Briefing - December 12, 2025 18:23 PST

### TL;DR
🚨 **TULE FOG EVENT CONTINUES WITH SLIGHT DETERIORATION** 🚨  
Five CRITICAL fog hours during tomorrow's duck curve (HE09-HE13) with peak 70% probability at HE11. Solar production severely compromised with 85% losses through HE13. **KEY CHANGE**: Ground conditions worsening - dewpoint depression drops to just 1°C (down from 2°C in previous runs). Afternoon clearing at HE14 remains intact with full solar recovery to 186 W/m².

**Fog Trend vs Previous Runs**: Conditions are **WORSENING** - KMOD METAR now shows critical 1°C dewpoint depression (down from 2°C), indicating increasing saturation despite stable fog probability patterns.

### ⚠️ TULE FOG WARNING - ACTIVE EVENT ⚠️

**CRITICAL ALERT**: Five consecutive hours of CRITICAL fog risk during peak duck curve period (HE09-HE13).

**Formation Factors Present:**
- **Dewpoint Depression**: 1°C (CRITICAL - down from 2°C)
- **Wind Speed**: 3 kt (below 8 km/h threshold)
- **Saturation**: Near 100% humidity in valley bowl
- **Peak Intensity**: 70% probability at HE11

**Solar Impact**: 
- **85% production loss** during fog hours (HE09-HE13)
- **Full recovery** beginning HE14 (186 W/m²)
- **Rapid afternoon clearing** as thermal mixing breaks fog layer

**Grid Operations Recommendation:**
- **Maintain full conventional backup through HE13**
- **Monitor HE13-HE14 transition** for rapid solar recovery
- **Weekend operations normal** - fog clears Saturday

## Agent Memory Summary

**Key Finding:** Tule fog event shows WORSENING ground conditions with dewpoint depression dropping to just 1°C (down from 2°C in previous runs), while peak fog probability at HE11 remains stable at 70%, indicating continued severe solar production impacts with deteriorating atmospheric saturation.

**Key Observations:**
- Ground truth METAR confirms deteriorating conditions with dewpoint depression now at critical 1°C threshold
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain exact timing pattern with peak at HE11 (70% probability) 
- Afternoon clearing pattern remains robust with solar recovery to 186 W/m² at HE14
- Weekend clearing strengthens with Saturday temperature rise to 6.6°C confirming fog breakup

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue recommending full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar production losses
- Alert operators to monitor rapid transition at HE14 as fog dissipates and solar production recovers
- Confirm weekend operations return to normal patterns beginning Saturday with improved temperatures

**Alert:** Tule Fog was detected during this run
