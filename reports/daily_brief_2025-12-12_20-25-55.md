# GRID SOLAR BRIEFING - Modesto CA
**Consensus Temperature Model** | Generated: Dec 12, 2025 20:26 PST

## TL;DR ALERT: FOG BREAKUP BEGINS - CRITICAL HOURS REDUCE FROM 5 TO 5

**IMPROVING CONDITIONS:** Peak fog probability DROPS to 72% (down from 84% in previous run). Ground truth validates with 1°C dewpoint depression. FIVE critical fog hours remain through HE13, but afternoon solar recovery STRENGTHENS to 186 W/m² by HE14.

## 🚨 TULE FOG WARNING - ACTIVE EVENT
**Status:** CRITICAL - Five hours of severe solar production impact  
**Peak Fog Probability:** 72% at HE11 (DOWN from 84% in previous run)  
**Fog Physics:** Dewpoint depression 1°C + calm winds = perfect fog formation

## Tomorrow's HE09-16 Duck Curve (Dec 13)

| Hour | Solar Adjusted (W/m²) | Risk Level | Fog Probability |
|------|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **HE09** | 7.1 | 🚨 CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 63% |
| **HE10** | 13.9 | 🚨 CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 68% |
| **HE11** | 20.8 | 🚨 CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | **72%** |
| **HE12** | 30.2 | 🚨 CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 67% |
| **HE13** | 31.5 | 🚨 CRITICAL (ACTIVE FOG) | 35% |
| **HE14** | 186.0 | ✅ LOW | 23% |
| **HE15** | 133.0 | ✅ LOW | 20% |
| **HE16** | 84.6 | ✅ LOW | 17% |

**CRITICAL IMPACT:** 85% solar production loss during HE09-HE13  
**RECOVERY TIMING:** Rapid clearing begins HE14 with full production restoration

## The Smoke Shade Analysis
**Status:** MODERATE - Light atmospheric haze present  
**Max PM2.5:** 40.2 μg/m³ (Friday morning)  
**Impact:** ~5-10% solar reduction during peak PM2.5 hours  
**Trend:** Decreasing through weekend, clear air by Tuesday

---

## Grid Operation Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (Today/Tomorrow):
- **Deploy conventional backup:** Full capacity through HE13
- **Monitor HE13-HE14 transition:** Rapid 500% solar production increase expected
- **Weekend operations:** Return to normal patterns Saturday with 6.6°C

### WEEKLY OUTLOOK:
- **Dec 15-16:** Strong clearing, optimal solar conditions
- **Dec 17-18:** Normal winter operations, clear air
- **Dec 19:** Storm system - expect minimal solar production

## Agent Memory Summary

**Key Finding:** Tule fog event shows STABILITY with peak fog probability holding at 72% (down slightly from 84% peak), but ground truth confirms continued critical conditions with 1°C dewpoint depression at KMOD, indicating the fog event is plateauing rather than intensifying.

**Key Observations:**
- Peak fog probability stabilizes at 72% during HE11 - down from 84% peak but maintaining severe impact levels
- Ground truth METAR continues to validate forecast with critical 1°C dewpoint depression and light winds
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain consistent pattern through HE13 with rapid afternoon clearing to 186 W/m²
- Light smoke haze present (40.2 μg/m³ max) adding minor 5-10% solar reduction on top of fog impacts

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar production losses during critical fog hours
- Alert operators to monitor rapid HE13-HE14 transition for 500% solar production increase as fog lifts
- Confirm weekend operations normalize Saturday with temperature rise to 6.6°C breaking fog pattern
