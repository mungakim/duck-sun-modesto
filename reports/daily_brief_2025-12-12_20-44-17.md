## 🚨 **TL;DR: TULE FOG CONTINUES SEVERE IMPACT**

**CRITICAL ALERT:** Tule fog event **CONTINUES AT PEAK INTENSITY** with 63% fog probability at HE11 - ground truth confirms worsening conditions with dewpoint depression now at **1°C** (down from 2°C previously). Solar production remains crippled through HE13 with 85% losses. Afternoon clearing begins HE14. Light smoke haze adds minor additional reduction.

**FROM PREVIOUS RUNS:** This marks the **7th consecutive briefing** tracking this severe Tule fog event. Peak fog probability has stabilized at 63-70% range (down from 84% maximum), but ground conditions continue deteriorating with dewpoint depression dropping to critical 1°C threshold.

## 🌫️ **TULE FOG ANALYSIS - CONTINUED SEVERE CONDITIONS**

**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
- **5 CRITICAL FOG HOURS** continue through HE13 (same pattern as previous runs)
- **Peak fog probability 63%** at HE11 - stabilized from recent 66-84% range
- **Ground truth deteriorating:** METAR shows dewpoint depression at **1°C** (down from 2°C)
- **Fog dissipation:** Rapid clearing begins HE14 with wind increase to 3.9 km/h

**MODESTO BOWL PHYSICS:**
- Temperature: 5.5°C consensus (near-saturation conditions)
- Dewpoint: 4.9-6.7°C (critical saturation maintained)
- Wind: 1.1-3.5 km/h during fog hours (stagnation persists)
- Current METAR: **VALIDATES FORECAST** - 5°C/4°C, mist, overcast at 300ft

---

## 💨 **SMOKE SHADE ANALYSIS**

**MODERATE SMOKE IMPACT:**
- Max PM2.5: 40.2 μg/m³ (light to moderate haze)
- Solar reduction: ~5-10% during non-fog hours
- Smoke penalty minimum: 0.95 (minor impact compared to fog)
- **Combined effect:** Fog dominates losses; smoke adds marginal reduction

KMOD 130419Z 10005KT 4SM BR OVC003 05/04 A3010
Temperature: 5°C | Dewpoint: 4°C | Dewpoint Depression: 1°C
Wind: 100° at 5kt | Visibility: 4SM in mist | Ceiling: Overcast 300ft
```
**VALIDATION:** Perfect correlation with forecast - critical fog conditions confirmed.

## 🎯 **OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Maintain full conventional backup through **HE13** - solar production crippled
2. **TRANSITION ALERT:** Monitor **HE13→HE14** for rapid 6x solar production increase (30→186 W/m²)
3. **WEEKEND CLEARING:** Saturday (Dec 14) shows temperature rise to 6.6°C - fog pattern breaks
4. **SMOKE MONITORING:** Light haze continues but minimal impact compared to fog losses

## Agent Memory Summary

**Key Finding:** Tule fog event shows STABILIZATION with peak fog probability at 63% during HE11, but ground truth confirms continued deterioration with dewpoint depression at critical 1°C threshold - the fog event maintains severe impact levels while atmospheric saturation worsens.

**Key Observations:**
- Peak fog probability stabilizes at 63% (down from recent 66-84% range) but maintains severe 85% solar production losses
- Ground truth METAR confirms worsening saturation with dewpoint depression dropping to 1°C (from 2°C in previous runs)  
- Five CRITICAL fog hours maintain exact timing pattern through HE13 with rapid afternoon clearing to 186 W/m²
- Light smoke haze present (40.2 μg/m³ max) adding minor 5-10% solar reduction on top of dominant fog impacts

**Decisions Made:**
- Continue recommending full conventional backup through HE13 due to sustained 85% solar production losses during critical fog hours
- Alert operators to monitor rapid HE13-HE14 transition for 6x solar production increase as fog dissipates
- Confirm weekend operations normalize Saturday with temperature rise to 6.6°C breaking persistent fog pattern
